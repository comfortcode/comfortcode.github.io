Hi! I’m a management professional and new web developer.

My work professionally with organizations fueled my interest in technology solutions that can help an organization’s workflow... Over time, that tech-focus at work renewed my long-time interest in developing beautiful, intuitive websites and applications.

Originally from the Baltimore area, I now live in Jerusalem, Israel. In the time spent away from a computer screen, I enjoy cooking and graphic design (okay, that’s by a computer screen too :-)).
